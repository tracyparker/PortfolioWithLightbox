           <h3>About The Artist</h3>
          </center>
          <p>Greetings! I'm Tracy Parker, and I'd like to welcome you to my site. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
          <p>I'm a Louisville, Ky based artist of many talents. My portfolio is a reflection of the winding road my artistic journey has been. A reflection of those who took the time to share their knowledge and creativity with me over the years. The pride in my accomplishments belongs to them as well.</p> 
          <p>I have a background in commercial art, and studio photography. I do most of my photography in a non-studio setting these days though. Events, local music venues, and the occasional protest rally. I'm especially fond of nature and macro photography.</p>
          <p>I was fortunate enough to stumble into apprenticing ceramics with world renowned Master Potter, Melvin Rowe. I apprenticed with Melvin for a little over 6 years at his studio, Pottery Rowe, on historic Frankfort Avenue, here in Louisville. In the Summer of 2014 however, after over 30yrs on Frankfort Ave., Melvin decided to scale back all <a href="http://potteryrowe.com">Pottery Rowe</a> operations to his personal ranch in Henry County, Ky.</p>
          <p>After repeatedly hearing that a lot of my photo manipulations were very fractal in nature, I began researching fractals. I learned how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot">Benoit Mandelbrot</a> was able to give visual life to mathematical eqautions using computers. During this research, I came across fractal art made with a program called "Mandelbulb 3D". It opened up a whole new artistic outlet for me. Most of my fractal art is made with the <a href="http://mandelbulb.com/2014/mandelbulb-3d-mb3d-fractal-rendering-software/">Mandelbulb 3D fractal rendering software.</a></p>
          <p>I'm currently a student in the <a href="http://codelouisville.org">Code Louisville</a> program. I built this site under the guidance of their mentors, and with the help of the <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">teamtreehouse.com</a> staff.</p>
